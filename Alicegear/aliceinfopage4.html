    While we have mentioned various pouches and accessories, this will be an overall list of all equipment
    pouches that are encompassed in the ALICE LC-2 system and a brief overview of their intended purpose, so that
    you may decide which ones will fill the role or purpose you need. We will only cover fighting load equipment
    as the existence load is a separate item that is intended to be used separately, usually worn over the fighting 
    load and should be removed before entry into combat if possible.  
</p>
<h1>Pouches for the LC-2 fighting load</h1>
<ul>
<li>Carrier, Entrenching Tool. This holds your entrenching tool or E-Tool and is to be used for digging foxholes
    or other forms of cover such as trenches</li>
<li>Case, field first aid dressing/compass pouch. This little pouch is intended to hold a single first aid dressing 
    or bandage or the standard issue compass, which is still standard issue to this day.</li>
<li>Case, Small Arms Ammunition. This is the most important pouch and holds three 30 round magazines of the 5.56mm STANAG 
    magazines for use in the M16 and M4 pattern of rifles. They will also hold two fragmentation grenades. Always have 
    two of these at least on your belt </li>
<li>Cover, water canteen. Have at least two of these as well, but these hold your canteens and water purification tablets. 
    it should be noted that you can carry magazines in here, this is generally not advised.</li>
<li>First Aid Kit, Individual. A one person first aid kit that when used properly can save your life</li>
<li>Case, Small Arms 200 round. Intended for the M249 SAW light machine gun holding a single belt of 200 rounds of 5.56mm ammunition
    on a disentigrating link system. This pouch is more suited as a genral purpose or dump pouch in civilian hands</li>
</ul>

    The butt pack is a complicated one as there was none officially adopted by the US Armed Forces, at least initially. The 
    original plan was to use the existing M1956, M1967, and other versions like the M1961. However in the 1990's the training
    butt pack was introduced in a woodland coloration. Your best bet is to go for these training packs as they are both cheaper
    than the original M1967 nylon packs, made of better materials than the canvas M1956, and best of all, it uses modern ITW Fastex 
    buckles to open and close the pack making it easier to use and it does have waterproofing capabilies, but I would still have a
    dry bag within the pack for more watersensitive items just to be safe.
